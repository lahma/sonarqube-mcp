/// schema can hold, because each schema only sees its own tool. Nothing loads that file at build
/// time, so it is exactly the kind of document that keeps advertising last month's tool surface.
/// This test is what makes the skill one of the five places a new tool has to be added, alongside
/// AGENTS.md's <em>Tool table</em>, <c>ToolInventoryTests</c> and the two arrays in <c>Build.cs</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It checks both directions. A name the skill uses that no tool answers to sends a model at a tool
/// that does not exist; a tool the skill never mentions is a tool the workflow silently drops.

/// <b>Calibration.</b> A reference is a backticked camelCase token whose leading lowercase run is
/// one of the verbs the inventory itself uses (<c>add</c>, <c>assign</c>, <c>get</c>, <c>list</c>,
/// <c>search</c>, <c>set</c>, <c>transition</c>) — the naming convention tool names follow. Tool
/// <em>parameter</em> names are excluded by reflection rather than by a hand-kept list, which is
/// what keeps <c>sortByMetric</c> and <c>issueStatuses</c> from reading as missing tools. The known
/// limitation is a result <em>field</em> that happens to start with one of those verbs, which would
/// have to be mentioned without backticks or added to the exclusions; that is a louder failure than
/// the alternative of matching nothing, which is why the pattern errs this way.
